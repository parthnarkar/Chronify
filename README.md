## Problem Description  

Individuals, students, and professionals often struggle with managing tasks, deadlines, and reminders due to poor or intermittent internet connectivity. Existing tools are either too complex, require constant online access, or fail to provide reliable reminders. This leads to missed deadlines, unorganized work, and decreased productivity.  
There is a need for a smart, reliable, and offline-first task management system that allows users to create, organize, and track tasks in real-time while ensuring smooth offline-to-online synchronization.  


## Expected Solution  

- A Progressive Web App (PWA) or mobile application that works seamlessly offline and syncs tasks when online.  
- Features for folder/project creation, task categorization, and dashboard view across all folders.  
- Task attributes: **title, description, status (pending/in-progress/completed), priority, and due dates.**  
- Real-time reminders and notifications (local & push) even when app is not open.  
- Offline data storage (**IndexedDB/local DB**) and automatic synchronization with backend.  
- Conflict resolution mechanisms when the same task is edited on different devices.  
- Secure backend APIs with authentication and scalability.  
- Responsive UI/UX for desktop and mobile.  



## Expected Outcome  

- Users can efficiently manage their daily tasks without worrying about internet availability.  
- A reliable reminder system ensures deadlines are not missed.  
- Improved productivity, especially for students, freelancers, and professionals in areas with unstable internet.  
- A lightweight, user-friendly platform that can be scaled for larger adoption.  



## Users Benefited  

- **Students** (assignments, deadlines, projects)  
- **Freelancers & Professionals** (client work, personal productivity)  
- **General Citizens** (daily task management, reminders)  
- **Users in low-connectivity regions** (rural/semi-urban India)  



## Additional Information  

- Solution should demonstrate **offline-first capability** and seamless synchronization.  
- **Bonus:** Multi-user support with shared task folders for collaboration.  
- Deployment must include working demo with **task CRUD operations, dashboard, offline usage, and notifications.**
